Quite happy to use markdown to draft document or blog post, but publish to web is 
a little trouble which need to 

1. find a web hosting
2. setup blog framework, or blog management program (e.g. wordpress)
3. design layout, menu navigation, etc..
4. start draft post

Can we just simply write to markdown file and post it?

Sure, try [casual-markdown-blog]! 

1. find a free web hosting. e.g. github-page
2. setup some basic info (e.g. blog site title, about me) in index.md
3. start draft posts in markdown.

the blog site is ready by add the file of [index.html](https://github.com/casualwriter/casual-markdown-blog/blob/main/source/index.html)
